Absolutely! Here’s a **creative and modern resume-style overview** of yourself — more like what you'd find in a standout personal site, portfolio intro, or even the top of a designer-friendly resume:

### 🧠 **About Me**

I’m a Computer Science undergrad (GNDEC, 2023–2027) who writes code not just to ship features — but to solve real problems. My tech journey kicked off with a humble hackathon where my team couldn't complete the project — but that moment *lit the spark*.

Since then, I’ve:

* 🛠️ Built a **browser-only cloud file manager** with just IndexedDB + localStorage
* ☁️ Engineered a **real-time cloud system** using AWS, Kafka, Redis & WebSockets
* 🎥 Integrated tools for **YouTube publishing, streaming**, and content collaboration
* 🔁 Explored **event-driven architectures** and team-based file sync flows

I’m obsessed with clean design, fast systems, and collaborative tools that scale — and I’m always building something new.

### 💡 Currently Building:

* **CollabTube**: A file manager built for creators and teams, with cloud sync, team folders, and streaming — think Google Drive meets YouTube Studio.
* **Open tools** for visualizing sensor data, local-first file systems, and PDF generation flows.

If you want a more animated or scroll-driven version for your site, I can help break this into sections like `Hero`, `About`, `Tech Stack`, and `Now Building`. Let me know if you'd like that!
